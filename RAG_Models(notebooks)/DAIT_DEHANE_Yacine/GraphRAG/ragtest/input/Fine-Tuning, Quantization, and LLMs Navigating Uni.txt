Abstract
Warning: This paper contains examples of LLMs that are offensive or harmful
in nature.
Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained widespread adoption across
various domains, including chatbots and auto-task completion agents. However,
these models are susceptible to safety vulnerabilities such as jailbreaking, prompt
injection, and privacy leakage attacks.
These vulnerabilities can lead to the
generation of malicious content, unauthorized actions, or the disclosure of
confidential information. While foundational LLMs undergo alignment training
and incorporate safety measures, they are often subject to fine-tuning, or doing
quantization resource-constrained environments.
This study investigates the
impact of these modifications on LLM safety, a critical consideration for building
reliable and secure AI systems.
We evaluate foundational models including
Mistral, Llama series, Qwen, and MosaicML, along with their fine-tuned variants.
Our comprehensive analysis reveals that fine-tuning generally increases the
success rates of jailbreak attacks, while quantization has variable effects on
attack success rates. Importantly, we find that properly implemented guardrails
significantly enhance resistance to jailbreak attempts. These findings contribute
to our understanding of LLM vulnerabilities and provide insights for developing
more robust safety strategies in the deployment of language models.
Introduction
Large language models (LLMs) are becoming crucial as they improve their ability to handle multiple
tasks, take autonomous actions and decisions, and improve their content generation and instruction-
following abilities. As these LLMs become more powerful, their capabilities are at risk of being
misused by an adversary, which can lead to unethical or malicious content generation, privacy leakage
Zou et al. [2023a], Greshake et al. [2023], Liu et al. [2023], Zhu et al. [2023], He et al. [2021], Le
et al. [2020]. To prevent LLMs from generating content that contradicts human values and to prevent
their malicious misuse, they undergo a supervised fine-tuning phase after their pre-training, and
they further undergo an alignment training phase with reinforcement learning from human feedback
(RLHF) Ouyang et al. [2022], or direct preference optimisation (DPO) Rafailov et al. [2023] to
make them more aligned with human values. Further, special filters called guardrails are put in place
to prevent LLMs from taking toxic prompts as inputs and outputting certain responses like toxic
content Rebedea et al. [2023], Kumar et al. [2023], Wei et al. [2023], Zhou et al. [2024]. Even after
these safety measures are installed, the complexity of human language, the huge training datasets
of LLMs and their huge parameter space make it difficult to secure these models completely. After
going through the alignment training and after the implementation of guardrails, the probability
that the LLM will generate a toxic response becomes low. But these safety measures can easily be
Preprint. Under review.

circumvented using adversarial attack strategies, and the LLM can be jailbroken to generate any
content according to the adversary's need, as shown in recent works Chao et al. [2023], Mehrotra
et al. [2024], Zhu et al. [2023].
Our contributions: In this work, we analyze the vulnerability of LLMs against jailbreak attempts
and show the impact of fine-tuning and quantization on LLMs, then we demonstrate the impact
of using guardrails as an input filter to make the LLMs safe. We distribute our analysis into three
components: Fine-tuned models, quantized models and the effect of using guardrails on safety.
* Fine-tune models: We utilize the open-source fine-tuned models from HuggingFace and
test them with our model evaluation pipeline.
* Quantized models: We test models available on HuggingFace, quantize them and then send
them to our evaluation pipeline.
* Guardrails: We showcase that using guardrails can drastically reduce the attack success
rate (ASR) of jailbreak attacks.
Related Works
Recent works such as the Prompt Automatic Iterative Refinement (PAIR) attacks Chao et al. [2023],
Tree-of-attacks pruning (TAP) Mehrotra et al. [2024], Deep Inception Li et al. [2023] have revealed
many vulnerabilities of LLMs and how easy it is to jailbreak them into generating content for harmful
tasks specified by the user. Similarly, a class of attack methods called privacy leakage attacks are used
to attack LLMs to extract personally identifiable information (PII)Kim et al. [2023], or some part of
their training data, and indirect prompt injection attacks can be used to make an LLM application
perform tasks that are not requested by the user but are hidden in the third-party instruction which the
LLM automatically executes. Qi et al. [2023] showed that LLMs trained on benign or adversarial
prompts increase their vulnerability towards 11 harmful risk categories.
Our work shows that LLMs, which are already fine-tuned on tasks such as code generation, SQL
query generation or general purpose to enhance the performance on a task, or LLMs, which are
quantized for a constrained environment, are also more vulnerable to adversarial attacks than their
corresponding foundational models. In this study, we use a subset of adversarial harmful prompts
called AdvBench SubsetZou et al. [2023b]. It contains 50 prompts asking for harmful information
across 32 categories. It is a subset of prompts from the harmful behaviours dataset in the AdvBench
benchmark selected to cover a diverse range of harmful prompts. The attacking algorithm used
is tree-of-attacks pruning Mehrotra et al. [2024] as it has shown to have the best performance in
jailbreaking and, more importantly, this algorithm fulfils three important goals: (1) Black-box:
the algorithm only needs black-box access to the model (2) Automatic: it does not need human
intervention once started, and (3) Interpretable: the algorithm generates semantically meaningful
prompts. The TAP algorithm is used with the goals from the AdvBench subset to attack the target
LLMs under different quantization and guardrails settings, and their response is used to evaluate
whether or not they have been jailbroken.
Preliminaries
Large Language Model
Large Lanugage Models (LLMs) operate in a self-auto-regressive manner, predicting sequences based
on previously given tokens. Let x1:n represent the token sequence, where each token xi belongs to
the vocabulary set {1, . . . , V }, and |V | denotes the vocabulary size. The objective of the LLM is to
predict the next token in the sequence, which can be expressed as:
Ppth(y|x1:n) = Ppth(xn+i|x1:n+i-1),
where Ppth(xn+i|x1:n+i-1) is the probability of the next token xn+i given the preceding tokens
x1:n+i-1. The model pth is parameterized by th, and y represents the output sequence.
Fine-tuning
Fine-tuning is the process of further training a pre-trained model or a foundation model on a
specialized dataset or for a specific task. This technique enables the model to refine its learned
representations and behaviors to suit more targeted domains or applications. Typically, fine-tuning
involves using a smaller, more focused dataset than the one used during the model's initial training,
often with adjusted learning rates and sometimes freezing certain layers of the neural network. The
primary goal is to improve the model's performance in specialized tasks or to tailor its outputs to
desired characteristics such as tone, style, or domain-specific knowledge like code while preserving
the broad language understanding gained from pre-training. The whole process revolves around
optimizing the loss function L:
L(ph) = -
log (Pph (yi,t+1 | xi, yi,1..t))
where ph is the set of training parameters of the model, I denotes the size of training data, yt+1 is the
current prediction, xi denotes the prompt, and yi,1..t denotes the corresponding response till time t.
Quantization
Quantization is a method used to lower the computational and memory demands of a model by reduc-
ing the precision of the numbers representing its parameters. This process involves converting the
model's weights and activations from higher-precision formats, such as 16-bit floating-point numbers,
to lower-precision formats like 8-bit. The goal of quantization is to preserve the model's performance
while significantly reducing its size and boosting inference speed, making it more practical to deploy
LLMs on resource-constrained devices or in environments with limited computational resources.
This can be simplified as:
Xq =
S * Xf
maxij(|Xfij|)
* Xf
= sf * Xf
where, Xq is the quantized output tensor, and Xf is the input tensor in floating-point format. S is a
scalar scaling factor, while maxij(|Xfij|) and Xfboth represent the maximum absolute value
of the input tensor. The effective scaling factor sf is given by
Xf . The expression is rounded to
the nearest integer, denoted by *.
Guardrails
Guardrails are a set of mechanisms, constraints, and filters put in place to regulate the behavior
and outputs of a model, particularly for LLMs. These safeguards are designed to ensure the model
functions within clearly defined ethical, safety, and operational parameters. By mitigating potential
risks such as generating harmful, biased, or inappropriate content guardrails help align the model's
responses with its intended use cases, legal requirements, and broader societal values. They serve
as essential controls to ensure responsible AI deployment while maintaining trust, reliability, and
accountability in various applications. It can be defined as guardrail function G(x)
G(x) =
if x = Unintended Query,
otherwise.
This proactive approach not only promotes the safe utilization of LLMs but also facilitates their
optimal performance, thereby maximizing their potential benefits in various domains Kumar et al.
[2023], Wei et al. [2023], Zhou et al. [2024].
Our Approach
To assess the vulnerability of Language Models (LLMs) to jailbreaking attacks, we have developed a
comprehensive evaluation pipeline. This pipeline is designed to test any LLM with or without any
Figure 1: Evaluation pipeline of LLM Vulnerabilities
guardrails. Our approach builds upon and modifies the existing Tree of Attacks and Perturbations
(TAP) algorithm Mehrotra et al. [2024].
Our evaluation process consists of the following key steps:
1. Attack Generation: We utilize the TAP algorithm to generate jailbreaking attacks on the
target LLM. The attack prompts are derived from the AdvBench subset Zou et al. [2023b],
which comprises 50 prompts soliciting harmful information across 32 distinct categories.
2. Multiple Runs: To account for the stochastic nature of LLMs, we conduct 3 experimental
runs for each model configuration.
3. Data Logging: After each run, our pipeline logs comprehensive evaluation results along
with complete system information in json format.
4. Success Metric: We use the ASR as our primary metric for assessing the effectiveness of
the jailbreaking attempts. The ASR provides a quantitative measure of how often the attacks
successfully bypass the LLM's safeguards.
Experimental Flow
Figure 1 illustrates the overall flow of our pipeline. It provides a visual representation of the entire
process, from attack initiation to result analysis.
This pipeline allows us to systematically evaluate the robustness of various LLM configurations
against jailbreaking attempts. By iterating through multiple runs and analyzing the resulting ASR
metrics, we can gain valuable insights into the effectiveness of different fine-tuning strategies,
quantization methods, and guardrails implementations in protecting LLMs against malicious attacks.
TAP Mehrotra et al. [2024] is employed as the jailbreaking method due to its effectiveness. It operates
as an automatic, black-box technique that generates semantically meaningful prompts to bypass
LLM safeguards. It utilizes an attacker LLM (Allm), in this case GPT-4o, which crafts and sends a
prompt p to the target LLM (Tllm). The target's response R, along with the original prompt p, is then
fed into an evaluator LLM (Ellm), which in our implementation is GPT-4o. The evaluator assesses
the attack's success and refines the approach if the model hasn't been jailbroken. This process is
represented as:
Ellm(p, Tllm(p) -R)
The algorithm repeats for a predetermined number of iterations or until a successful jailbreak occurs.
This result of this process is used to compute the Attack Success Rate (ASR):
ASR =
if Ellm(p, Tllm(p) -R) = Success,
otherwise.
Experiments & Results
In this section, we highlight the unintended consequences that arise from manipulating the weights of
foundation models through finetuning or quantization. The LLMs are tested under three scenarios: (1)
fine-tuning, (2) quantization, and (3) guardrails (ON or OFF). They are chosen to cover most of the
practical use cases and applications of LLMs in the industry and academia. For TAP configuration,
as mentioned before, we use GPT-4o as the Allm, and Ellm. We employ the OpenAI API, and
HuggingFace to get our attack, target, and evaluator model. The results of the experiment under
different conditions are described below:
Analyzing Effects of Fine-tuning
We compare the jailbreak vulnerability of foundational models compared to their corresponding
fine-tuned versions. It is empirically shown that fine-tuning does increase the vulnerability of LLMs.
The reason could be that the LLM start to forget its safety training due to catastrophic forgetting
Rafailov et al. [2023]. There are some strategies which could be employed to mitigate this risk while
fine-tuning such as mixing the fine-tuning data with safety tuning data, but this still increases the
vulnerability although by a smaller extent Qi et al. [2023], Weyssow et al. [2023]. we examine a range
of foundation models and their corresponding fine-tuned versions, focusing on their capabilities and
applications in various natural language processing tasks. The foundation models under consideration
include Llama3.1, Llama3, Qwen2, Llama2, Mistral, and MPT-7B. These models serve as the base
architectures for a variety of specialized applications. Building upon these foundation models, we
analyze several fine-tuned versions that have been optimized for specific tasks or domains. These
include Hermes-3-Llama-3.1-8B, LongWriter-llama3.1-8b, Hermes-2-Pro-Llama-3-8B, and Hermes-
2-Theta-Llama-3-8B, which are derived from the latest Llama family of models. Additionally, we
explore task-specific models such as llama-3-sqlcoder-8b for SQL code generation, and dolphin-2.9-
llama3-8b for general-purpose applications. Our analysis also encompasses other notable fine-tuned
models, including CodeLlama for programming tasks, SQLCoder for database query generation,
and the general-purpose Dolphin model. Lastly, we examine Intel Neural Chat, which represents an
industry-specific application of foundation model technology. From the table 1, we can empirically
conclude that fine-tuned models lose their safety alignment to a great extent and are much easily
jailbroken compared to the foundational model counter-parts.
Analyzing Effects of Quantization
We opt for Llama model variants as they have lowest ASR % among foundation models. We quantized
Llama Models in three formats 2-bit, 4-bit and 8-bit. Table 2 presents a comprehensive comparison
of various Llama model variants as they are the most robust foundation models. So,, focusing on
their vulnerability to jailbreak attacks. The data shows that 2-bit quantization significantly enhances
vulnerability across all models, highlighting a considerable security risk with aggressive quantization.
In contrast, as the quantization bit depth increases from 2 to 8 bits, there is a general reduction in
vulnerability. This trend suggests that higher bit depth quantization may better preserve the model's
learned safeguards, and in some cases, may even offer improved protection compared to the original
models.
Analyzing Effects of Guardrails
Guardrails function as essential safeguards, acting as a filter to prevent harmful or malicious prompts
from reaching LLMs as executable instructions Rebedea et al. [2023]. In this study, we utilize
Enkrypt AI's guardrails1 to evaluate their effectiveness in mitigating these risks. The guardrails are

implemented at both the query and response stages of the model pipeline, ensuring a comprehensive
filtering mechanism. Our observations reveal that around 67% of potentially harmful queries are
intercepted at the query stage itself, significantly reducing the risk of malicious prompts being
processed. The remaining instances are effectively managed by the response guardrails, ensuring
that inappropriate content is neutralized before being delivered as a response. As shown in Table 3,
these results underscore the effectiveness of guardrails in providing a robust defense against jailbreak
attempts, offering a reliable method to enhance the security and integrity of LLM interactions.
The results from tables 1, 2, and 3 conclusively show the vulnerability of LLMs post fine tuning
or quantization, and it also demonstrates the effectiveness of guardrails in mitigating the challenges
associated with increase safety vulnerabilities.
Conclusion and Future Work
Our study reveals complex relationships between model fine-tuning, quantization, and vulnerability
to jailbreaking attacks. The findings underscore the importance of considering safety implications
when optimizing language models for specific tasks or deployment scenarios.

Impact of Fine-tuning
Fine-tuning a model for a specific task generally improves its performance in that domain. However,
our results, corroborating the findings of Qi et al. [2023], demonstrate that this process can signifi-
cantly impact the model's safety vulnerabilities. As shown in Table 1, fine-tuned models consistently
exhibited increased susceptibility to jailbreak attacks compared to their foundational counterparts.
This heightened vulnerability could be attributed to several factors:
* Specialization trade-off: As models become more specialized, they may lose some of the
broader contextual understanding that helps maintain safety boundaries.
* Optimization focus: The fine-tuning process may prioritize task performance over main-
taining robust safety measures.
Effects of Quantization
Our investigation into model quantization yielded nuanced results:
* Excessive quantization: We observed that aggressive quantization techniques significantly
increased the model's vulnerability to jailbreak attacks. This suggests that excessive reduc-
tion in model precision can compromise its ability to maintain consistent ethical boundaries.
* Moderate quantization: Interestingly, models quantized to 4-bit and 8-bit precision demon-
strated improved resilience against jailbreaking attempts compared to the original models.
This unexpected finding hints at a potential "sweet spot" in quantization that might enhance
model robustness.
Implications and Future Work
These findings have important implications for the deployment of language models in real-world
applications. They highlight the need for a careful balance between task-specific optimization,
computational efficiency, and maintaining robust safety measures.
Future research directions could include:
1. Optimal quantization strategies: Investigating the mechanisms behind the improved safety
in moderately quantized models and developing quantization techniques that enhance both
efficiency and security.
2. Safety-aware fine-tuning: Exploring methods to incorporate safety considerations directly
into the fine-tuning process, potentially through multi-objective optimization approaches.
3. Transferability of vulnerabilities: Examining whether vulnerabilities introduced by fine-
tuning are task-specific or if they generalize across different types of malicious prompts.
4. Robust evaluation frameworks: Developing comprehensive benchmarks that assess both
task performance and safety metrics to guide the development of more secure and capable
language models.
In conclusion, while fine-tuning and quantization are powerful tools for optimizing language models,
their impact on model safety is significant and complex. As the field advances, it is crucial to develop
techniques that enhance performance without compromising the ethical and safety standards of these
increasingly influential AI systems.
Ethics Statement
The central goal of this research is to explore the potential safety and security risks linked to the
misuse of large language models (LLMs). Our research is guided by a strong commitment to ethical
principles, including respect for all individuals, especially minority groups, and an unwavering stance
against violence and criminal activities. This study aims to uncover the vulnerabilities in current
LLMs to help in creating more secure and reliable AI systems. The inclusion of any potentially
harmful content, such as offensive language, harmful prompts, or illustrative outputs, is strictly for
academic purposes and does not represent the beliefs or values of the authors.
