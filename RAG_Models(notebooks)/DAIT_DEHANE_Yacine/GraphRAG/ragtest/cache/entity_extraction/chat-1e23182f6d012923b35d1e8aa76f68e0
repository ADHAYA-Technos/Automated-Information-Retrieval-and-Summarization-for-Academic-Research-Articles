{"result": " (\"Entity_types\", \"organization,person,geo,event\")\n   (\"Text\", \"- BERT is a pre-trained deep bidirectional transformer for language understanding. In essence, it is trained by predicting words in a sentence given the other words, also called masked language modeling. It has a lot of widely used descendants trained for many different tasks, such as BioBERT (Lee et al., 2019), SciBERT (Beltagy et al., 2019), and CamemBERT (Martin et al., 2020). While BERT is already a considerably large model, nowadays far larger models, like GPT-3 from Brown et al. (2020), are trained. Compared to BERT's base model with 110 million parameters, GPT-3 has 175 billion parameters, however, GPT-3 is not publicly available and cannot be easily fine-tuned due to its size.\n   2.2 Data Augmentation\n   Data augmentation is the concept for artificially enlarging the training datasets for machine learning by transforming the existing ones. Originated and heavily used in computer vision, it is now also increasingly being explored on textual data (Bayer et al., 2022). NLP data augmentation techniques can be applied to the raw text or also on the numerical representations. Ranging from small transformations, i.e. flipping characters (Belinkov and Bisk, 2018) or inducing adversarial examples (Reimers et al., 2017), to more complex ones like back-translation (Sennrich et al., 2016) or paraphrasing (Zhang et al., 2019), these techniques aim to improve the robustness and generalization of models.\")\n   (\"Entity\", [\"BERT\", \"GPT-3\", \"BioBERT\", \"SciBERT\", \"CamemBERT\", \"Brown et al.\", \"Lee et al.\", \"Beltagy et al.\", \"Martin et al.\", \"Belinkov and Bisk\", \"Reimers et al.\", \"Sennrich et al.\", \"Zhang et al.\"])\n   (\"Person\", [\"Not specified\"])\n   (\"Geo\", [\"Not specified\"])\n   (\"Event\", [\"Not specified\"])", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.
