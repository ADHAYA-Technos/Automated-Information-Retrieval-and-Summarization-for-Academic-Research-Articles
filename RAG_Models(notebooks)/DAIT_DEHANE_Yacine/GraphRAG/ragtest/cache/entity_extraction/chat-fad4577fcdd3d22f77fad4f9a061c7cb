Due to memory-bandwidth bottlenecked oper-\nations taking up to 40% of the training time [22], this improvement\nmay lead to much faster training times for both small and large\nmodels. At the same time, computational capabilities on embedded\ndevices for mobile edge computing are significantly growing, with\nthe NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin 64GB being the first-of-a-kind DL-\naccelerated embedded device that provides capabilities for training\nFMs [9]. This has never been possible before and enables us to\nbuild FL workloads with large transformer models, benefit from\nscattered data, and bring generative AI closer to users, all the while\nimproving data privacy.\nAs this type of device is oftentimes scattered across geographies\nand entities, federated DL (FL) imposes itself as a well-suited tech-\nnique for fine-tuning FMs in a distributed and private fashion.
