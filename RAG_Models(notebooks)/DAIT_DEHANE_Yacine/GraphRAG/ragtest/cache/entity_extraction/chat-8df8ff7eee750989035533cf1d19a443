These findings suggest the need for further investigation into machine unlearning evaluation criteria without relying on a retrain-from-scratch oracle. KL Temperature. To assess the impact of KL temperature, we conduct experiments using [0.5, 5] with a 0.5 step and keep the learning rate for CIFAR to 7 x 10^-4, MUFAC to 4 x 10^-3 and FER to 5 x 10^-3. These values were the most optimal with respect to Eq.

In all datasets, the accuracy on Dt does not present high variations and remains constant across different temperature values. In CIFAR, higher values lead to increased accuracy on Df, while in MUFAC and FER, a reverse trend is evident. Interestingly, a temperature of 1 consistently results in high MIA efficacy, suggesting that SFTC's default = 1 is robust and effective for inducing unlearning, without needing precise temperature adjustments.\n\nConfusion Fraction.
