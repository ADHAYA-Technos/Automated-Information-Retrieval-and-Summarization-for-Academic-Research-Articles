The fine-tuning process generally begins with collecting examples of desired model behavior and performing supervised learning. Some models stop at SFT (Chiang et al., 2023), while InstructGPT follows this by training a reward model based on binary human preference data. The fine-tuned model is then further refined using RLHF, using a signal from the reward model. In the example of InstructGPT, the algorithm used is Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017\")\n   (\"entity\"<|\"organization\", \"LLMs\">, \"A type of machine learning models that are fine-tuned for various purposes.\")\n   (\"entity\"<|\"person\", \"<unknown>\")\n   (\"entity\"<|\"geo\", \"<unknown>\")\n   (\"entity\"<|\"event\", \"The process of fine-tuning LLMs, specifically the use of heterogeneous feedback data and techniques like SFT, RLHF, PPO.\")", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.
