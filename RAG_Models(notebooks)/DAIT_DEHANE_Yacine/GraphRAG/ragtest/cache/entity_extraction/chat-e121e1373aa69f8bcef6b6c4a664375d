The endeavor sought in this work takes an even stronger stance on labeling reduction by proposing a system with few-shot learning, transfer learning, and data augmentation. With few-shot learning, it is sufficient if the model is already trained with very few instances, as opposed to hundreds or thousands in the case of active or normal learning (Brown et al., 2020). This includes special learning techniques as well as transfer learning, where knowledge from a previous task is transferred to the new one. Data augmentation is used to create artificial instances from the training data using label-preserving transformations (Bayer et al., 2022). The concept of few-shot learning is extended in this work through the use of multi-level transfer learning. The different levels start with a model that has been trained on a large general dataset and thus has a basic prior knowledge. During the next steps, this model is approximated more and more to the actual task domain. In this way, it can be ensured that the model is given a basic cybersecurity reference in order to be able to counter the dynamics in the task, in addition to being familiar with the task.
