However, if we want to gain access to a broader data basis, we need to foster FL on the edge and bring FM to embedded devices. At the same time, new regulations like the European Union AI Act impose new limitations and requirements for FL [43] that need to be met such that applications become practical. This entails the need to prioritize energy efficiency. For FL, this is an underexplored area as most existing works either perform microbenchmarks for FL clients [27, 5] or focus on communication cost reduction [13]. The combination of resource limitations and increasing regulatory requirements presents us with a set of challenges:\n(1) Comparably low memory bandwidth on embedded devices limits the compute potential of FL applications on the edge. We currently see a generation leap in data center DL accelerators regarding memory bandwidth, which has increased significantly (up to 7.8 TB/s). Even though the memory size on embedded devices has increased, the memory bandwidth remains comparatively low (up to 0.2 TB/s). This affects key memory-bandwidth bottlenecked operations for the training process, which could lead to severe training time penalties.\n(2) Energy efficiency has become a priority with the introduction of the EU AI Act. The new regulation requires service providers that offer FL applications to focus on energy-efficient operations. To this point, energy efficiency can only be achieved by optimizing the hardware and software design for low power consumption.\",\n    \"Entities\": {\n        \"organization\": [],\n        \"person\": [],\n        \"geo\": [],\n        \"event\": [\"The combination of resource limitations and increasing regulatory requirements presents us with a set of challenges\"]\n    },\n    \"Relationships\": [\n        {\"subject\": \"FL\", \"object\": \"applications\", \"verb\": \"limits\"},\n        {\"subject\": \"data center DL accelerators\", \"object\": \"memory bandwidth\", \"verb\": \"increased significantly\"},\n        {\"subject\": \"memory size on embedded devices\", \"object\": \"has increased\"},\n        {\"subject\": \"memory-bandwidth bottlenecked operations\", \"object\": \"affects\"},\n        {\"subject\": \"service providers\", \"object\": \"offer FL applications\", \"verb\": \"require\"},\n        {\"subject\": \"energy efficiency\", \"object\": \"can only be achieved\", \"verb\": \"by\"}\n    ]\n}", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1.
