Although there are various sources for benign and DGA-based domains, and several datasets used in research on detecting malicious domain names are available (such as AmritaDGA (Vinayakumar et al., 2019) and UMUDGA (Zago et al., 2020)), a standard benchmark dataset has not yet been established [21]. In this paper, we utilize a combined dataset consisting of three different sources: one dataset for benign domains, which includes the Alexa Top 1 Million Sites collection of reputable domains 1; and two datasets for DGA domains, sourced from Bambenek Consulting's malicious algorithmically-generated domains 2 and the 360 Lab DGA Domains3. Finally, the dataset is created by merging and shuffling these three datasets 4. In total, our DGA dataset comprises 1458863 domains that are DGA-based and 1000000 domains that are Alexa domains.
