Finally, we evaluate the model's performance across the entire dataset and flowalerts/LLM benchmark it against state-of-the-art models using different datasets, including the 25-DGA dataset. We first evaluate the performance of the LLM model without any prior training on malicious or benign domains, a process known as testing the pre-trained model. The main motivation is that since LLM models are trained on vast corpora, they might perform well on this task; if the pre-trained model effectively distinguishes between benign and malicious domains, it could be used without further adjustments like fine-tuning for specific tasks. We use prompts such as '['role' : \\\"user\\\", \\\"content\\\" : msg, ]', where msg is give me yes or no answer?'.

Identify all entities.
